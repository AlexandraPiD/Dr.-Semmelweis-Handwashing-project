# Dr.-Semmelweis-Handwashing-project
A DataCamp project exploring the correlation between doctors' handwashing practices and occurrences of childbed fever.

# Dataset:
The dataset, used in this analysis, was provided by DataCamp and it comprises historical records documenting incidents of childbed fever and information on doctor's handwashing projects.

# Analysis:
The analysis involves examining the relationship between doctors' handwashing habits and the occurrence of childbed fever cases. I employ data visualization techniques to explore correlations within the dataset.

# Results:
The lack of handwashing was a significant correlating factor to the cases of childbed fever among women after childbirth. Handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval.
